# MTH377 - Convex Optimization

### Assignment 1
Problems on
- **Gradient Descent**: uses Linear Approximation of function
- **Newtonian Descent**: uses Quadratic Approximation of function; applicable only on twice-differential convex functions
- **Combination Descent**: combines the two Descent philosophies, by checking for convexity

### Assignment 2
Problems on the Interior Point Algorithm (IPA)
